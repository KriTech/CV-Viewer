The entire project was developed by me José Enrique Montañez Villanueva
This is a test code project that aims to show my skills as an iOS developer.
This is a simple application that displays my resume information in a list format and separated into cells. The information is taken from a remote file hosted on GitHub in the URL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KriTech/assets/master/CV.json", also in this repository I put an image of mine to show in the application
This project contains simple unit and UI test cases, for these tests, the project also contains a copy of the file hosted on GitHub, so that the cases start to execute faster, this can be changed just by passing the URL of the remote file to the function "fetchAndParseCV".
